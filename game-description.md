# Title: Game Week

### Description

It's college football season and you are getting ready for Saturday's game. As a player you know that each day you need to consider your training, nutrition and rest in order to be ready for the game. Your challenge is to go through each day of the week. Make a decision to foucs on one of the three areas, then try and get the most benefit from the preparation.  If you do well, on game day you will be strong, which will make it easier for you to score a touchdown. 

# Game

### Strength

Your strength increases or decreases each day based on the challenge. Based upon your strength on day 7 (Game Day), you will get a different number of chances to score a touchdown. 

Strength Range: 0 to 100

Game Day Chances based on Score: 
- 0 to 30: 2 downs
- 31 to 60: 4 downs
- 61 to 90: 8 downs

### Scoring Touchdown

- On gameday you will score a touchdown if you win the 'guessing game', therefore each chance is another guess. The range used for the guessing game will be 0 to 50.

### Day Challenges 

Your have three choices each day to focus your preparation:  Physical Training, Nutrition, Rest. 

1. Physical Training: Guessing Game, using 1 to 15, with three guesses. 
..* Win = score 15
..* Lose = score 0

2. Nutrition: Rock, Paper, Scissors like game- but using nutritional terms.. creatine, Sword, whey protein. The scoring is the same as that of physical training, where you get 15 points if you win and 0 points if you do not. Somewhat arbitrarily chosen the hiearchy of the items is: 
..* Whey > Creatine
..* Creatine > Sword
..* Sword > Whey

3. Rest: Because there are so many factors that influence rest, this is a random chance game. A random number between 0 and 100 is generated. If the number is below 50 then you win the 'good night sleep lotto' and get 15 points. If the number is above 50 you lose and get sleepy and don't get any points. 

## Wishlist for game enhancements: ##

1. Improve gameday play. Give options to player on different ways they want to try and score a touchdown (running vs. passing vs. special teams). Each option changes probability of scoring a touchdown. 

2. Add logic to game, so that the daily decisions by the player increases or decreases the players ability to earn points. For example, if they select 'physical training' 3 days in a row, they would only be able to earn a max point increase of 10 points. 

3. Add games to the 'physical training' option, so the player can choose different types of training, such as weight, conditioning, rehab, etc.
